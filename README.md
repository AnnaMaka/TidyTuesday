# TidyTuesday

This repository will my contributions to [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenges. I started on Week 32 (2022) and I will try to participate at least twice a month.

If you download the Github Repo, you should be able to run my code to reproduce or improve my contributions. If you have suggestions for improvements or any feedback, feel free to get in touch!
